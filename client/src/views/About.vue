    <h1>About me and this project</h1>
    <p>
      I'm always learning, and I took an new work opportunity as an excuse to make a weekend project with two technologies I didn't know yet: Symfony and VueJs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started by buying a new domain name and choosing a little problem to solve. <br/>
      I choose:
      <ul>
        <li>http://florent.tech</li>
        <li>Navigating in  <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the Marvel Api</a></li>
      </ul>
      This projects was started on friday evening, and you can follow tghe progress on <a href="https://github.com/fbeauchamp/florent.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> github</a>
